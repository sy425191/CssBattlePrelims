                        I believe it's priced a little bit on the higher side but still it's better than its
                        competitors.

                        Display is less bright than I hoped, with okayish resolution. I have put it on 'Performance
                        boost'
                        24/7 mode which reduces battery life but it does feel a bit more snappy and fast. It doesn't
                        feel
                        premium in the hand but it's '4 camera layout' tricks others that it's a Rs12000+ phone; atleast
                        from afar.

                        This mobile is purely for normal use, I don't recommend this for heavy users.
                        Camera is ok. The battery is really working good and long lasting. Samsung
                        could have given a better processor. I will recommend to choose other mobile in
                        this price range according to processor. Otherwise everything is ok ok.

                        100% suitable for my parents & business usages.

                        Wonderful Sony sensors .... Samples speaks a lot than my words.
                        Software upgradation will boost camera stabilization and performance a lot .
                         Am impressed... Low light performance is amazing .
                          Awesome Flipkart deals and offers quick delivery. Decent Battery backup for whole day , super fast Charing, No heating issues.
